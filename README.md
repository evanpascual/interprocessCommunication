## Running the Client 
1. In a terminal, compile and run the Client.java file:
```ruby
#Client.java

#compiles the Client class
javac Client.java 

#runs the file
java Client
```
2. After the program asks for a valid ip address and port number, the user is then prompted to run the server.

2. This will run the prompt to the user to enter a message to echo.
3. The user can quit the program using ```^C``` in both terminals
